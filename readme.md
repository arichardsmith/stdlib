# stdlib

A personalised Typescript stdlib

This repo houses a bunch of functions and types I find myself commonly writing. It's not intended to be a published package, instead it should be cloned into a project - or the neccessary files can just be copy-pasted in. Given how lightweight the items are, it is better to vendor than add another mystery dependency.
